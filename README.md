# Shasper Substrate

This is an attempt to implement "Ethereum 2.0" specifications using the Substrate framework. Note that there's nothing much here yet and everything can disappear in any minute!

Here is the [2.1 spec](https://notes.ethereum.org/SCIg8AH5SA-O4C1G1LYZHQ) from Danny Dyan.

What we get / planned so far:

* [ ] State transition
* [ ] Fork choice rules
